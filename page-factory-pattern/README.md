# Page Factory Design Pattern

## About Page Factory Design Pattern

* Page-Factory allows you to write autotests in a human-readable language, thereby lowering the entry threshold for test developers and increasing their readability by untrained users. Page-factory uses the Cucumber-JVM framework, but unlike pure use, in which a fairly large part of the architecture is occupied by steps (stepdefs) , here the emphasis is on getting rid of the need to write them yourself, or reducing the number of self-written steps (stepdefs) focusing on describing the code of pages using the PageObject pattern .

* Page-Factory has already implemented many standard steps , which are enough to start developing automated tests.

* Page-Factory is a cross-platform framework that allows you to run tests on all popular browsers, because Selenium WebDriver is used to run them. Page-Factory can also work with an Android application using Appium.

## Requirements

To work Page-Factory you need:
1. Java 7 or higher


## Applicability

Use the Page Factory pattern when,

* You are writing automated tests for your web application and you want to separate the UI manipulation required for the tests from the actual test logic.
* Make your tests less brittle, and more readable and robust
